He was a professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics.</p>\n<p>As an assistant professor and associate professor of anthropology at Yale from 1998\u20132007 he specialised in theories of value and social theory.

He went on to become, from 2007\u201313, Reader in Social Anthropology at Goldsmiths, University of London.</p>",
